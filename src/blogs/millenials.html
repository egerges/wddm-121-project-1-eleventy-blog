    "definition": "Millennials grew up with computers, the Internet and the graphical user interface (GUI). This familiarity makes them adept at understanding interfaces and visual languages. They tend to adjust readily to new programs, operating systems (OS) and devices and to perform computer-based tasks more quickly than older generations. Although it’s been proven that multitasking is not usually an effective way to work, Millennials may be the employees that are most likely to pull it off.",
    "more": "Even though Millennials are very dependent on the Internet for learning how to do things, it's likely they do not really understand how the internet works. When their computers or devices don’t work, Millennials often have difficulty troubleshooting technical problems. In contrast, the technically-inclined members of Generation X usually have a deeper understanding of programming and hardware issues because they were actively participating in the evolution of the internet."
