        <p>Generation Z (aka Gen Z, iGen, or centennials), refers to the generation that was born between 1997-2012, following millennials. This generation has been raised on the internet and social media, with some of the oldest finishing college by 2020 and entering the workforce.</p>
        <p>Generation Z, is the youngest, most ethnically-diverse, and largest generation in history, comprising 27% of the US population. Gen Z is defined as anyone born after 1996. Gen Z grew up with technology, the internet, and social media, which sometimes causes them to be stereotyped as tech-addicted, anti-social, or &#39;social justice warriors.&#39;</p>
